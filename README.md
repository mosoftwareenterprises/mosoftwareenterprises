- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark Oliver, I have been developing since the late 90's.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things dotnet (especially C#), Domain Driven Design, Microservices, Blazor... the list goes on and on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so much of everything. Every day is a school day, this one is Blazor WASM!
- I'm documenting my thoughts on all the things I learn in life and dotnet on my blog here https://blog.markoliver.website/
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything dotnet related.
